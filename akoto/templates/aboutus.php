            <p>We at AkotosGHBoutique have a tremendous passion for all things Africa and in particular the riches of Ghana.</p>
            <p>During a recent excursion to Ghana, our love was renewed by the scenic views, beautiful culture, and multifaceted talents found in the people.</p>
            <p>We intend to showcase some of that allurement in the quality pieces we will offer. One particular treasure found in Ghana is the African print fabric. It is so very vibrant and alive, and its dominant presence in the fashion industry is a natural fit.</p>
            <p>We will introduce to you some of the most talented fashion designers, artists and seamstresses, along with the rich fabrics they use to create our signature pieces.</p>
            <p>One of the Ghana's premier handmade handbag designers is Sa4a (Safoa).  This creative and well-educated woman, while managing her home affairs,  was able to turn her passion for fashion into a brand. She launched her company in 2009, and is now well-renowned throughout various continents.  She is known for her exceptional use of beautiful leathers and skins, combined with African wax print(ntomah).</p>
            <p>Some of our other notable talents are our amazing artists. They are local artists from Kumasi, Ghana, where they live and create their masterpieces.</p>
            <p>Each one of their paintings are uniquely designed and beautifully crafted.</p>
            <p>It is our hope that you can share in the richness of this beautiful land....Akwaaba (Welcome in Twi)</p>
